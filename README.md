C++ Expression Tree

A console application built in C++ that uses a binary tree data structure to parse, manage, and evaluate arithmetic expressions. The program takes an infix expression as input, builds the corresponding tree, and provides a menu to perform various operations.

## Core Features

Parses an infix arithmetic string to construct a binary expression tree.

Calculates the final result of the expression.

Displays the tree structure, including node values and pointers.

Searches for specific nodes by value.

Reports the tree's height and total node count.
